I'm a big fan of the Fallout universe and our office recently had acquired a couple of 3D printers. 

Made with ❤️ at Spring Valley ARK

The printer used is a LulzBot TAZ 6 

I got the Pip-Boy 3D model from Yvo de Haas at [https://ytec3d.com/pip-boy-3000-mark-iv/](https://ytec3d.com/pip-boy-3000-mark-iv/)

Feel free to check out his site along with his other amazing projects.
