I was using cheat.sh for a while now and wondered if it has a chmod calculator included and to my dismay it didn't have the feature yet.

Made a suggestion at [here](https://github.com/chubin/cheat.sh/issues/197) and a few weeks later [ErezBinyamin](https://github.com/ErezBinyamin) implemented a script.

Was psyched when it was live!

You can try it out using

```
curl cheat.sh/chmod/644
curl cheat.sh/chmod/rw-r--r--
```
