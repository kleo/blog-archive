I'm a big fan of the Fallout universe and our office recently had acquired a couple of 3D printers.

Made with ❤️ at Spring Valley ARK

The printer used is a LulzBot TAZ 6

I got the Pip-Boy 3D model from Yvo de Haas at [https://ytec3d.com/pip-boy-3000-mark-iv/](https://ytec3d.com/pip-boy-3000-mark-iv/)

Feel free to check out his site along with his other amazing projects.

Pip-Boy boot sequence

I made a script [pipboy-3000-boot](https://github.com/kleo/pipboy-3000-boot) which shows the Pip-Boy boot sequence. I copied it off from the .swf resources of the apk file Pip-Boy companion app.

Combined with [cool-retro-term](https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term) here's what it looks like.

Papercraft

I found a really cool website which features free papercraft models from different games, shows and movies! Check out [Cubefold](https://cubefold-craft.com)

You just need to print, cut, fold and glue. It takes time to make but it's really worth it.
