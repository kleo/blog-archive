I still have this note dated 2013-07-04 named grub.txt.           

```
set root=(hd0,msdos6)
set prefix=(hd0,msdos6)/boot/grub
insmod normal
normal
```

I found out about Linux first at a Apple Store lol. 

This was at Plazuela de Iloilo, probably went there to wander at new shops with my parents.

One of those laptops they sold that wasn't a Mac came in preinstalled with Ubuntu.

I wondered what is this? A computer not running Windows or MacOS? What is this sorcery?

It had a peculiar animal as a wallpaper, turns out the Ubuntu version was Precise Pangolin.

When we went home I had to try it out.

It was no easy matter to start, with it not properly working after install.

On startup it boots to a grub prompt which was very disappointing.

After looking far and wide trying out different solutions I finally found the fix and made the note above.

I was hoping this was the last problem I have on using Linux. 

Or is it?
