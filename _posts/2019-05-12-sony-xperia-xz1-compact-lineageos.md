Installed LineageOS 16 RC1 and it gave a new life to my phone.

Instead of just a battery life of just half a day. It now can still go on for more than two days.

FDroid included. No more bloatware.

Awesome battery management and it also comes with extreme power saver. Fully charge in just under an hour with the stock charger.

Performance is great with the exception of occasional reboots. No NFC support as of now, Camera quality is the same with stock with Sony Camera application now included.

I can now enable/disable root with a switch.

Play Store is optional, you can get it from opengapps.org

Comes with Android 9 Pie. Stable release candidate as of 2019-06-11 although still unofficial. To the work of modpunk and company I thank you very much!

I'll be watching out for RC2
